# Annotated Reading of the **Essentials** Section of the *Vue.js Guide*

<!--
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48429998/data-prefix-is-added-to-custom-attributes-how-to-prevent-this
-->
These are my notes written in pandoc markdown [@casiano] from reading the guide of Vue.js (v2) [@vuestart], the book [@djirdeh2018fullstack], [@awesomevue], [@vuejsfundamentals],
[@vuejscomponentsfundamentals]  and other [references](#references).

This document only covers
the initial sections of the *Essentials* part of the Guide, from section *Introduction* up to section *Computed Properties and Watchers*.  

These notes have been ellaborated using [pandoc](https://pandpc.org) to translate it the markdown to HTML.

At the current time (December 2021), this notes are experimental, since the HTML generated by pandoc has some incompatibilities with Vue and I had to resort to some awful tricks to made them work.


1. I'm using the [pandoc-include](https://github.com/DCsunset/pandoc-include) filter
2. The citation styles have been taken from [@citationstyles].

To see the result, you can 

1. Open the deployment in the  GitHub pages <https://crguezl.github.io/learning-vue-geting-started-guide/> of the repo [crguezl/learning-vue-geting-started-guide](https://github.com/crguezl/learning-vue-geting-started-guide) containing the notes or
2. To install it locally, fork the repo. You have to have `pandoc` installed and  then
   1. Run `npm install-pandoc-dependencies` to install `pandoc-include` 
   2. Run `npm start` to compile the sources and open the resulting `index.html` file. 

!include introduction.md

!include the-vue-instance.md

!include template-syntax.md

!include computed-properties-and-watchers.md

## Exercise: Vuejs Fundamentals

Follow the tutorial at [@vuejsfundamentals], reproduce the examples and leave the results in folder `vuejsfundamentals` of the assignment repo
